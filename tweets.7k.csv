952	weak	low	3 2	1	221	0.45249	pubpolicy 1 Rep. Rob Menendez menendez.house.gov	First - and this is important - budgets are a reflection of the Administration’s values, and Trump’s budget not just fails to support American families, but it weakens the very institutions that support our democracy.
953	weak	high	0	2	260	0.76923	pubpolicy 1 Rep. Rob Menendez menendez.house.gov	Healthcare cuts put nearly 2 million New Jerseyans - pregnant women, children, seniors, and those with disabilities - at risk of losing access to care.   That means fewer cancer screenings, less preventative care, more ER visits, and higher costs for everyone.
954	weak	low	18 13	1	300	0.33333	pubpolicy 1 Rep. Rob Menendez menendez.house.gov	Slashing affordable housing, specifically over $26B from federal rental assistance programs, and cutting the entire LIHEAP energy assistance program means more families without a safe, warm place to call home.   We need to invest in programs that make housing more affordable; this does the opposite.
955	015	high	15	2	230	0.86957	pubpolicy 1 Rep. Rob Menendez menendez.house.gov	With education and childcare costs rising, the budget slashes $4.5 billion from K-12 education. That hurts working families the most - especially parents trying to stay in the workforce. These cuts weaken families and the economy.
956	007	high	7	2	212	0.94340	pubpolicy 1 Rep. Rob Menendez menendez.house.gov	For seniors, this budget cuts critical programs like the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. Cuts for seniors lead to impossible choices - between medicine and groceries and between staying warm and staying fed.
